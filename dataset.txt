I can't give up locations, no information
You know we don't say shit 'cause we fighting cases for real
Fuck it got saved by a deal, you never felt how it feels
Your money counterfeit, my money real
You might go down and it's all up from here

I got blinded by love and that shit fucked me up
And that's all that I fear, all that I fear
Bitch it's my year, bitch it's my year
Love is all that I fear

In East Atlanta really whippin' with the kitchen fork
Bitch ride with me, my bitch ride for me
My bitch lie for me and my bitch ride on me

When they crack the gate I'm right back balling
Would you come to the visits?
If they say I murdered a nigga and they had an eyewitness?
Would you help me hide if I jumped bail?
When they ask questions bitch don't tell
Would you have another nigga driving in my car?
Take the money out the safe and then fuck it off?

Would you stay around?
Or would you switch like a snitch
Turn your back, get cold feet and jump ship
I don't need no broke bitch
I need a bitch who gon' listen
Cook dope out the pot, clean the kitchen
Don't be so promiscious
Can I trust you with my stash?
If they pop me would you secure bags?
Would you spend my last?
If I lost all I had
Would you visit me behind the glass?
I just have to ask, if I went down
Would you hold it down, would stay around

Avoiding your love, never gave me grace
Spending all my time away
Better to want you in retrograde

But she gon' always be around
Kept it right out of the doubt

Used to be pissed off 'til I got home

Every time I go soft, baby, go hard
When you on TO you gon' send me more than postcards

Bitch, you had to been to county jail to live to tell this shit
Prison saved my life 'cause I know I was supposed to die that year
Bitches want my life so they just started actin' hella weird
Niggas want my wife, that's not my wife, might fuck my other bitch
Don't you close your eyes, we stayin' woke like Donald Glover, bitch
Watch her snort a line right off the dick before she suck the dick
Suffocate the pillow talk, just hold it down and smother shit
They comparing me to Pac so I got on some walkin' shit
Shout out to my lil homies hittin' licks and flockin' shit

I heard 03 got all the heat
My side, two bitches in one whip
Niggas thought it was all over
Beatin' me, how can I sober
Say I'm surrounded by vultures
Now I'm surrounded by soldiers
Should we get right to the gunplay
He got a hundred he gon' say
I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard, I heard, I heard
I heard, I heard

That we went down undercover
I'm back out on bail and I'm still raising hell
Feeling like Slater or Screech, got a white girl with me and got saved by the bell
Look at me funny, they want me to disappear like I'm Dave Chappelle
I get it out of thin air, still gettin' packs in the mail
What type of drugs do you sell?
Last year I needed some help
Now I can get it myself
I was the shit in the cell
Thought I won't get out of jail
People sayin' I got ninety-nine years
I got ninety-nine sales for your bitch and I'm here
Ninety-nine problems but bitches ain't near
Xanny barbarian like I'm golden ear
Purple a soldier but I don't romance
I'm usually off a few lines when I dance
Baby got me in the times when I glance
I turn a white girl and pry with no hands
Kitchen whippin' 'til I go down again
Drummer gang family, we don't want no friends
Test that nigga to the final exam
I left the hood like the white boys and text the Trans-Ams
Free my bro Speed, let's get back to them grams
Free Facka Flee, free Yapo every time
Free Scavy D, slugs on me, this God's plan
